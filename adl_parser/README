= Usage

The script 'bin/adl_validator.rb' validates given ADL files.

  Usage: bin/adl_validator.rb [file_name|http://location.to.adl]+ [options]
      -v, --verbose                    display verbose message(Not Implemented Yet)
      -h, --help                       display this help

In order to validate an ADL file on your local machine, just give the file name as an argument as follows.

 $ bin/adl_validator.rb tests/openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.exam-chest.v1.adl
 =>
 Accepted 'tests/openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.exam-chest.v1.adl'

If you want to validate a remote ADL file on the web, specify its URL location.

 $ bin/adl_validator.rb http://svn.openehr.org/knowledge/archetypes/dev/adl/openehr/ehr/cluster/openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.auscultation-chest.v1.adl
 =>
 Accepted 'http://svn.openehr.org/knowledge/archetypes/dev/adl/openehr/ehr/cluster/openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.auscultation-chest.v1.adl'

In addition, you can try unit testing.

 $ rake test
